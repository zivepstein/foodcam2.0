										<h2>Which meals would this impact and how would it be enforced?</h2>
										<p>Food funding is decentralized. Media Lab funds are spent on meals across four categories: 
											<ol>
												<li>All-lab lunches, Lean Box, and other vending machines (purchased by facilities)</li>
												<li>Research group and class lunches (purchased by groups and professors)</li>
												<li>Individual purchases (e.g. reimbursed dinners from travel)</li>
												<li>Member meetings and other special events</li>
											</ol>
										</p>
										<p>A plant-based food diet would not be formally enforced. This is a proposal for the community to agree to act upon a golden rule.</p>

<!-- 
										<h2>Is this a ban on all animal-based food in the Media Lab?</h2>
										<p>No! We do not deal in black and whites, and don't expect this to happen overnight. Our primary goal is to foster a different distribution of food options, and this can come in many forms, such as:</p>
											<ol>
											<li>Subbing out beef (the biggest contributor of GHG by a long shot) for chicken</li>
											<li>A menu of 85% plant-based and 15% meat.</li>
											<li>Going pescetarian!</li>
											<li>For weekly food purchases, alternating "normal" food consuption with a veggie options.</li>
										</ol>

											<p>Food is about community, and this is a conversation that must be had within your community. We know different approaches will work for different situations, and we only hope this starts those conversations</p>

										 </p> -->

											<h2>Does this mean I can't eat meat in the Media Lab?</h2>
										<p>No! The policy should just be what is purchased through lab funds. Folks are of course free to eat or bring whatever they want. </p>

										<h2>What does this have anything to do with FoodCam?</h2>
										<p>FoodCam was a radical new technology that seemed quite weird at the time. After some trialing, folks realized it could reduce waste at the lab while being a visible artifact of the lab's values of prototyping and communal effort. We propose a FoodCam2.0: turning the camera back onto ourselves to translate our values into climate action. Let's hold ourselves accountable to our sustainability goals!</p>

										<h2>What are next steps?</h2>
										<p>We are deeply curious how the broader community thinks about this idea, and want to get people's feedback on it. Please fill out the survey so we can know where people stand and can respond to what people want. We will make the survey results available during the Festival of Learning to scaffold a public conversation.</p>
